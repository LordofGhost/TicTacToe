# Tic Tac Toe

This is a terminal based TicTacToe game.

I created this project because I was interested in the miniMax algorithm and fascinated by the idea of creating an AI that is better in a game than myself.

## Enemy AI

The AI searches for every possible move and every corresponding possible counter-move by the player. It does this recursively until all possible outcomes of the current state have been compared. Then the best one is executed.
